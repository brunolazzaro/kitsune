### Extra optimizations:
* You can add a `Loadable` (https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable) and use Dynamic Imports for code splitting (https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-webpack)
* You can add an alias to `preact` by using `preact-compat` (https://github.com/developit/preact-compat)
